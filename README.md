# What You See Is What You Get

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/spa/wysiwyg && cd $_
touch index.html
touch wysiwyg.js
touch wysiwyg.css
```

## Requirements

1. Create an array of objects that represents famous people (see structure below).
1. Create a text input in your DOM.
1. Beneath that, create a container, block element in your DOM.
1. Create a DOM element for each of the objects inside the container. Style your person elements however you like.
1. For every even numbered element, have a light yellow background.
1. For every odd numbered element, have a light blue background.
1. Each element's DOM structure should be as shown below.
1. When you click on one of the person elements, a dotted border should appear around it.
1. When you click on one of the person elements, the text input should immediately gain focus so that you can start typing.
1. When there is a highlighted person element, and you begin typing in the input box, the person's biography should be immediately bound to what you are typing, letter by letter.
1. When you press the enter/return key when typing in the input field, then the content of the input field should immediately be blank.


##### Sample Person Element & Children

This is just a sample and is not what your final HTML will look like. You need to add all the appropriate **id** and **class** attribute needed to make it work as intended.

```html
<!-- ///
  HTML is a flexible specification. I just made up the person tag,
  and that's perfectly legal. You can then style it with CSS however
  you wish.
/// -->
<person>
  <header>Name and title go here</header>
  <section>Bio and image go here</section>
  <footer>Lifespan info goes here</footer>
</person>
```

##### Object structure

```js
{
  title: "Samurai",
  name: "Tomoe Gozen",
  bio: "Serving under Minamoto Yoshinaka, Tomoe was one of his finest soldiers, and her skills in battle dwarfed many of those held by even the strongest men in her unit.",
  image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Tomoe-Gozen.jpg"
  lifespan: {
    birth: 1747,
    death: 1797
  }
}
```

## Helpful Tip

We've discussed in class how you cannot add an event listener to an element that you expect to be in the DOM *in the future*. An element has to exist in the DOM tree before you can invoke the `addEventLister()` method on it.

Luckily, you can use JavaScript to add an element to the DOM and then immediately attach an event listener to it.

Here's an example of what would *not* work, and one that would.

##### Incorrect

```js
// containerEl will be an empty array
var containerEl = document.getElementsByClassName("person__container");

// Nothing will happen here since there is nothing in the array
for (var i = 0; i < containerEl.length; i++) {
  containerEl[i].addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    // Logic to execute when the element is clicked
  });
}

var counter = 0;
var outputEl = document.getElementById("outputEl");
for (; counter < 5; counter++) {
  // Give each person element a unique identifier
  outputEl.innerHTML += `<div class="person__container" id="person--${counter}"></div>`;
}
```

##### Correct

```js
var counter = 0;
var outputEl = document.getElementById("outputEl");
for (; counter < 5; counter++) {
  // Give each person element a unique identifier
  outputEl.innerHTML += `<div class="person__container" id="person--${counter}"></div>`;
}

// Now containerEl will have elements in it
var containerEl = document.getElementsByClassName("person__container");

// Event listeners are created
for (var i = 0; i < containerEl.length; i++) {
  containerEl[i].addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    // Logic to execute when the element is clicked
  });
});

```
